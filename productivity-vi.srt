00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,687
Hi there, today we'll talk about some of our productivity

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,591
tips and features in VS code. We want to make

3
00:00:10,654 --> 00:00:13,873
it easy for you to get started, get comfortable and

4
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:17,155
get coding. The first thing we'll talk about is the

5
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:20,879
command palette. The command palette is the easiest way to

6
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:24,287
find something in BS code. If you're ever looking for

7
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:27,128
a feature or a shortcut or an action from an

8
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:28,580
extension, go to view.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,100
Command palette.

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,100
Or use the keyboard shortcut.

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,688
In the command palette you'll also see the associated keyboard

12
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:40,869
shortcut for every command that has one.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,612
Next I'll show you how to quick open a file

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,420
on Windows control. P will show you your recently opened

15
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:52,426
files and you can search for any file in the

16
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:56,769
repository you currently have open. Selecting the file will open

17
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:59,374
it in a new editor. You can also add a

18
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:02,180
colon after the name of a file and type A

19
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:05,587
line number and a new editor window will open. Add

20
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:06,789
that line number.

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,844
You can do the same thing with the @ to

22
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,460
go to a symbol in a file.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,965
Type the question mark to view command to questions that

24
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:17,390
might be useful to you.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,331
Repeat the quick open keyboard shortcut to cycle quickly between

26
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:23,730
recently opened files.

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,472
You can also open multiple files from quick open by

28
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:31,003
pressing the right arrow key. This will open the currently

29
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:34,773
selected file in the background and you can continue selecting

30
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,150
files from quick open.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,119
Multi Cursor selection is another really useful editing feature on

32
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:45,309
Windows. You can all Click to add a new cursor

33
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:46,869
anywhere in your file.

34
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,571
You can also set cursors above or below your current

35
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:55,611
position using control alt up arrow or control Alt down

36
00:01:55,683 --> 00:02:00,083
Arrow. You can even add additional cursors to all occurrences

37
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:03,329
of the current selection with shift control.

38
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,810
This is useful for editing or deleting multiple occurrences of

39
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,310
repeated code in a file.

40
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,842
This one's really simple, but I highly encourage you to

41
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:16,009
take a second to do it. Go to file.

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,690
Autosave and make sure you have autosave turned on.

43
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,278
A couple of other settings you can configure are format

44
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:30,440
on type and format on Paste set editor format on

45
00:02:30,504 --> 00:02:33,537
type to true to auto format your text each time

46
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:36,634
you type A line. You can also set editor format

47
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,860
on paste to true to format your text whenever you

48
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,989
paste new text into your editor.

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,703
Finally, let's talk a little bit about Intellisense. Intellisense is

50
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:51,367
a general term for various code editing features like code

51
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:54,845
completion and quick info. It's provided out of the box

52
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:58,013
for some languages in VS code, but you can install

53
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:02,733
language extensions to have richer Intellisense for specific languages. Let

54
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:05,901
me show you an example with JavaScript. If I start

55
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:08,820
typing the name of a variable, it will show me

56
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:12,236
what variables are available in this file. If I select

57
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:13,230
one, then type.

58
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,960
I'll be given a list of all the properties and

59
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:19,107
methods accessible to that variable. I can pick a method

60
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:21,703
and go to add a parameter which will then show

61
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:23,360
me info about that parameter.

62
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,241
You can trigger and tell a sense in any editor

63
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,997
window by typing^ space or by typing a trigger character

64
00:03:31,063 --> 00:03:34,621
such as the dot character in JavaScript. Check out our

65
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:39,168
Intellisense documentation for more in depth information. I hope you

66
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:43,979
enjoyed following along and learned something new. For more information,

67
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:48,460
