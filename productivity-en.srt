2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,687
Hi there. Today we'll talk
about some of our productivity

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,591
tips and features in VS code.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,873
We want to make it easy
for you to get started,

5
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:16,000
get comfortable, and get coding.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,879
The first thing we'll talk
about is the Command Palette.

7
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:21,287
The Command Palette is the
easiest way to find something

8
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:22,287
in VS code.

9
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:24,287
If you're ever looking for
a feature, or a shortcut,

10
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:27,128
or an action from an extension,

11
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:28,580
go to View,

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,100
Command Palette.

13
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,100
Or use the keyboard shortcut.

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,688
In the Command Palette,

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,688
you'll also see the
associated keyboard shortcut

16
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:40,869
for every command that has one.

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,612
Next, I'll show you how
to Quick Open a file.

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,420
On Windows Control P will show
you your recently open files

19
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:52,426
and you can search for
any file in the repository

20
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:54,769
you currently have open.

21
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:57,769
Selecting the file will
open it in a new editor.

22
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:02,180
You can also add a colon (:)
after the name of a file,

23
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:05,587
and type a line number, and
a new editor window will open

24
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:06,789
at that line number.

25
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,844
You can do the same thing
with the add (+) sign

26
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:11,460
to go to a symbol in a file.

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,965
Type the question mark (?)
to view command suggestions

28
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:17,390
that might be useful to you.

29
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,531
Repeat the Quick Open keyboard shortcut

30
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:23,730
to cycle quickly between
recently opened files.

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,472
You can also open multiple
files from Quick Open

32
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:30,003
by pressing the right arrow key.

33
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:32,773
This will open the currently selected file

34
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,550
in the background and you
can continue selecting files

35
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:36,650
from Quick Open.

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,819
Multi-cursor selection
is another really useful

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,119
editing feature.

38
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:45,309
On Windows, you can Alt
Click to add a new cursor

39
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:46,869
anywhere in your file.

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,571
You can also set cursors above or below

41
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:54,000
your current position
using Control Alt Up Arrow

42
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:56,000
or Control Alt Down Arrow.

43
00:01:56,083 --> 00:02:00,083
You can even add additional
cursors to all occurrences

44
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:03,329
of the current selection
with Shift Control L.

45
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,810
This is useful for editing or
deleting multiple occurrences

46
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,310
of repeated code in a file.

47
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,000
This one's really simple

48
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:15,009
but I highly encourage you
to take a second to do it.

49
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,009
Go to File,

50
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,890
Auto-Save

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,690
and make sure you have
Auto-Save turned on.

52
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,278
A couple of other
settings you can configure

53
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:29,440
are Format On Type and Format On Paste.

54
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,537
Set Editor Format On Type to
True to auto format your text

55
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:35,000
each time you type a line.

56
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:38,900
You can also set Editor
Format On Pace to True

57
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:40,860
to format your text
whenever you paste new text

58
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:41,989
into your editor.

59
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,703
Finally, let's talk a little
bit about IntelliSense.

60
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:50,000
IntelliSense is a general
term for various code

61
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:53,000
editing features, like Code
Completion and Quick Info.

62
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:57,145
It's provided out of the box
for some languages in VS code.

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,500
But you can install language extensions

64
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,733
to richer IntelliSense
for specific languages.

65
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:05,001
Let me show you an
example with JavaScript.

66
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:07,820
If I start typing the name of a variable,

67
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:11,000
it will show me what variables
are available in this file.

68
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:13,230
If I select one, then type period (.),

69
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,960
I'll be given a list of all the properties

70
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:18,500
and methods accessible to that variable.

71
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,703
I can pick a method and
go to Add A Parameter,

72
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:23,360
which will then show me
info about that parameter.

73
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,241
You can trigger IntelliSense
in any editor window

74
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,997
by typing carrot space (^ ) or
by typing a trigger character

75
00:03:31,063 --> 00:03:34,621
such as the dot (.)
character in JavaScript.

76
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,000
Check out our IntelliSense documentation

77
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:39,168
for more in-depth information.

78
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:42,000
I hope you enjoyed following
along and learn something new.

79
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,979
For more information,

80
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:48,000

81
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:48,460
Happy coding!

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
