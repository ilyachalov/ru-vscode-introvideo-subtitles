1
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,998
This is Visual Studio Code, a lightweight but powerful code editor.

2
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:09,998
In the next few minutes, I'm going to start

3
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:12,998
from scratch so you can follow along and we're going

4
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,998
to write and execute some code in JavaScript, Python and

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,998
HTML. And along the way, explore the features of this

6
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:22,998
code editor. Once installed and launched, the first thing

7
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:24,998
that I want to do is show you how to

8
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:27,998
open a folder to set your workspace, which you can

9
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,998
just do by going through this folder icon here and

10
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:33,898
clicking open. Or you can use the shortcut and in

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:33,998
my case.

12
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:36,998
That's command O. Now, I know that I want my

13
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:39,998
workspace to be in my documents folder under getting started,

14
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,998
so all I have to do is highlight that folder

15
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:45,998
and click open on the left hand corner, you'll see

16
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:48,998
under explorer my folder name getting started and any files

17
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,998
that I have under there which is currently none. Now

18
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:54,998
that we've got a folder open, let's take a quick

19
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:57,998
look at the editors so you know the purpose of

20
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:00,998
some of these buttons and sections. On the far left

21
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:02,998
is the activity bar and the first icon is for

22
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:03,998
the explorer.

23
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:07,998
To see your folders and files, below is a magnifying

24
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:10,998
glass to search, find and replace text in files across

25
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:14,998
your whole workspace. Then there's source control to track changes

26
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:17,998
in code with Git and GitHub. Next is run and

27
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:21,998
debug to execute code and debug it using breakpoints. The

28
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,998
extension marketplace to add additional features to our code editor

29
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:28,998
and then a couple of icons for your account and

30
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,998
to manage settings. But at the very top center we

31
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:34,998
have our command palette which you can go to

32
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,998
View and select it as your first option or use

33
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:40,998
the shortcut. The command palette is very important as it

34
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,998
is the Control Center for all commands in Visual Studio Code

35
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:46,998
At the bottom of the screen is the status

36
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,998
bar, where on the left we'll see a number of

37
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,998
errors or warnings and on the right the current line

38
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:55,998
number and programming language right above that is a panel

39
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:59,998
for output or debug information, problem details and an integrated

40
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,998
terminal. So let's go ahead and create a new file.

41
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,998
I can go over here and select new file.

42
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,998
Or hit command and quickly notice at the bottom right

43
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:12,998
hand corner it says plain text. But once I start

44
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:17,998
typing console dot log, open parentheses, immediately it notices its JavaScript and

45
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:22,998
at this point once I start writing anything else, Intellisense

46
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:25,998
is going to kick in. I write CON and it's

47
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:29,998
like, oh, you want to write confirm console? It's trying

48
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,998
to predict exactly what I want to write. I hit

49
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,998
the dot, the letter L.

50
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,998
Do you want to write log? Yeah, it's reading my

51
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:42,998
mind practically, this is Intellisense. It's that smart completion. All

52
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,998
I'll write is rise and shine. And on the next

53
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,998
line, ready for a new day. And if I hit

54
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:51,998
command+S, I will save my file as jsSample.js

55
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:54,998
and hit save and you know you need to

56
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,998
save whenever it's a change made because if I hit

57
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:01,998
the spacebar here, you'll see that there's a dot that

58
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,998
shows up, which means I need to save and if

59
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,998
I want to have to avoid.

60
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:08,998
Having to save every single time I can go to

61
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:11,998
file, autosave and any little change that I make, it

62
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:14,998
immediately saves it and now to execute our code I

63
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,998
hit F5 and as you can see below, rise and

64
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:19,998
shine ready for a new day.

65
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,998
Now let's write something in Python. I'll create a new

66
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:26,998
file command+n and I will save it as pythonSample.py

67
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,998
So, Visual Studio Code at the bottom right hand

68
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,998
corner notices that it's Python, but if I start actually

69
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:37,998
writing code, you'll notice that I don't have that Intellisense,

70
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:41,998
and in fact I could write almost anything here, and

71
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,998
it's not giving me any type of warning. So for

72
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:48,998
language like Python, extra support is needed, and that's where

73
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,998
we could use an extension.

74
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,998
Which is the first one recommended here? So now it's

75
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,998
installing and it will give us Intellisense, Linting which is

76
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:01,998
going to give us that squiggly line whenever there is

77
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:04,998
an error debugging and some more capabilities. So now

78
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:07,998
if I start writing I get that Intellisense and I

79
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:11,998
can finish writing my statement and if I put in

80
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:14,998
some nonsense here it will give me a warning and

81
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,998
now I can add some more code to execute it

82
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:20,998
by hitting F5.

83
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:23,998
Python has entered the building or I could also execute

84
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:28,998
it by hitting this run button here.

85
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:33,998
Now, how about demonstrating something with HTML so instead of

86
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:37,998
creating a new file, what I do want to demonstrate

87
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,998
is that you can just bring in a file into

88
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:44,998
the Explorer section. So if I go and choose Explorer,

89
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:48,998
I already have some prepared HTML that I'm going to

90
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:51,998
drag in from another folder, and when I drop it,

91
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:55,998
a copy of this file will be created into my

92
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:59,998
workspace under getting started. And here is just some simple

93
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:00,998
HTML.

94
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:03,998
Now with HTML, we can't execute it from the terminal,

95
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,998
but what we can do is use an extension that

96
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:10,998
will open a browser preview right in Visual Studio code

97
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,998
next to your HTML and CSS, and that extension is

98
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:17,998
called Live Preview and we want the one specifically by

99
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:21,998
Microsoft which is the first one here. So I'll install

100
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,998
that, head back to the explorer and now all I

101
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,998
need to do is right click on my HTML file,

102
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:30,998
select show preview and there you have it within

103
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:34,998
Visual Studio Code. Now this version doesn't seem too attractive

104
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:37,998
because there's no styling to it. I do have another

105
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:40,998
example. I can go ahead and drop in and this

106
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:43,998
includes some bootstrap styling and I'll do the same. Right

107
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:47,998
Click show preview. This looks a little bit better. I'll

108
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:50,998
hit command+minus so you could have a better view.

109
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:53,998
And what's great about this is you can make some

110
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:56,998
changes and you'll see the results on the fly and

111
00:05:56,999 --> 00:06:00,898
that is great. I'll increase my screen again hitting

112
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:00,998
command+plus.

113
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:03,998
The last thing that I want to show you is

114
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:07,998
that VS Code is extremely customizable not only with functionality

115
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:10,998
features but also with the way that it looks by

116
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,998
changing themes. So for example, if I were to go

117
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,998
to the command palette which we mentioned earlier by hitting

118
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:20,998
command+shift+P and I typed in theme, I can

119
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:23,998
choose color themes and start scrolling up and down through

120
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,998
the different themes that are available. and if you don't

121
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:30,998
see what you like, there's an option for browse additional

122
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:31,998
color themes.

123
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:34,998
You can choose that and search for a lot

124
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:38,998
more that's available online, and you could scroll through a

125
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,998
bunch of these. Or, if you already know the name

126
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,998
of your theme, you can just search by just typing

127
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:47,998
it in. Like I know one that's called night owl.

128
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,998
I'll choose a first and see how everything looks with

129
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:52,998
my new theme. So I just showed you how easy

130
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:56,998
it is to execute some code in Python, JavaScript and

131
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,998
HTML using Visual Studio code. And also we explored some

132
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:01,998
of its features like Intellisense,

133
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:05,998
the extension marketplace and also how to customize it with themes,

134
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:09,998
but that barely scratches the surface, so to learn more
